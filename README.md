# AI-in-Finance-Industry-Sentiment-Analysis
The energy industry, from upstream to middle stream and then to downstream, comprising production, distribution and refinement of oil, gas, and renewable energy, plays a vital role in the global economy. Fluctuations in energy prices as well as commodity changes can significantly impact various financial markets and investment portfolios. Understanding the energy sectorâ€™s sentiment is crucial for risk management and investment optimization before market fluctuation.
Our project aims to enhance predictive accuracy in energy sector sentiment analysis using advanced data transformation and machine learning techniques. By simply deriving the cumulative returns of energy factors over a two-month period, we strive to provide reliable prediction results that aid in making investment decisions. We begin by detrending time-series data to remove linear trends, ensuring our models capture intrinsic market variability. Using robust rolling principal component analysis (R2-PCA), we perform dimensionality reduction to extract meaningful information while mitigating minor noise. We implement various classification models to predict binary outcomes of market movement. Additionally, we explore deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. To further enhance model robustness and address non-stationary data issues, we incorporate an economic regime framework, improving the generalization ability of our models. Through this project, we demonstrate how advanced analytics and machine learning can provide valuable insights into energy sector sentiment, helping investors reduce risk and make better-informed portfolio decisions.
