This project proposes robust rolling PCA (R2-PCA) that accommodates the additional aspects and mitigates commonly found obstacles including eigenvector sign 
ipping,and managing multiple dimensions of the data-set. Based on R2-PCA, Machine Learning and Time Series Forecasting techniques are implemented to predict the uncorrelated trends and signals in various industries for risk management in asset allocation.
